# Creating a Todo List by using react with typescript!


## Using - Generic Type

Generics offer a way to create reusable components. Generics provide a way to make components work with any data type and not restrict to one data type. So, components can be called or used with a variety of data types. With this Generics feature, we can convert this functionto a Generic function.

For this we use a special syntax here, after the function name,in front of the parameter list, we add angle brackets and in here we can define a Generic type which will only be available inside of this function.
